## End-to-End Fitness Movements Tracker Application using Sensor Data

Medium article will be published soon.. For now, short summary is below:

In this comprehensive project, I developed a fitness tracker powered by Python. The primary focus was to use Python scripts to analyze accelerometer and gyroscope data, enabling the creation of a machine learning model adept at classifying and counting repetitions of specific barbell exercises such as bench press, deadlift, and squats. The data utilized originated from a meta motion sensor device, which was previously collected over a three-year period.

Throughout the instructional series, the project was broken down into several phases. It began with an introduction, data collection, and visualization, progressing to outlier detection. A significant segment centered on feature engineering, with in-depth discussions on frequency, numerical features, time features, and clustering. Subsequently, the focus shifted to predictive modeling, where different classifiers were constructed and their effectiveness compared. The project culminated in the development of a custom algorithm to count repetitions, aiming to enhance the fitness tracker's overall functionality. The project reflects a broader trend towards leveraging machine learning in wearable technology to seamlessly log fitness activities, echoing advancements seen in the industry.
